			<b>History:</b><br>
			<a href="images/durbar_square.jpg"><img src="images/durbar_square.jpg" height="150" weidth="150"align="right" hspace="10"></a>

			Founded in the 12th century by King Ananda Malla (according to various chronicles),
			Bhaktapur was the capital city of the Greater Malla Kingdom until the 15th century and was an independent kingdom 
			from then until the 18th century.<br>

			The last three Malla rulers of Bhaktapur were Jitamitra Malla, Bhupatindra Malla, and Ranjit Malla. These rulers played
			key roles in building the palaces and temples of Durbar Square.<br>

			In 1744, Prithvi Narayan Shah, descendent of Dravya Shah, who was the founder of the Gorkha dynasty, began a conquest 
			march in the Kathmandu Valley, capturing and unifying Kathmandu, Patan, Bhaktapur, and the
			smaller towns of the Valley under one rule.<br>

			After a period of instability and a bloody coup in 1846, Jang Bahadur Kunwar Ranaji took control of Nepal. His Rana 
			dynasty ruled Nepal until 1951, when the Congress Party formed a new government. In 1960, King Mahendra took control,
			banned political parties, and instituted land reforms. Political turmoil continued throughout the late 20th century.<br>

			In 1934, a major earthquake destroyed over 2,000 houses and severely damaged over 2,000 more homes. Over 1,000 people died 
			in this quake. Restoration of many buildings was undertaken over the years, including efforts funded by West Germany 
			in the late 1980's and by the U.S. in the 1990's.<br><br>

			Festival chariot in Bhaktapur, NepalBhaktapur is filled with Hindu and Buddhist religious sites and art. 
			Although the population is primarily Hindu, there are nineteen Buddhist monasteries (Vihars). At Indra 
			Varna Madavihar, built in 1671 and located between Durbar Square and Dattatraya Square, visitors can see two
			lion statues, a Patinga Hiti (water spout), Tantric wood-carved windows, and prayer wheels.<br>

			There are also many Buddhist monuments and shrines, including Lokeswor Mahavihar, Prasannasheel Mahavihar, 
			Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Jaya Kirti Mahavihar, Sukra-varna Mahavihar, Dipanker Mahavihar.<br>

			Many festivals are celebrated throughout the year to mark the seasons, pay tribute to gods, and remember
			historical and legendary events. A few of these are:

			* Dashain, the longest festival of the year, lasting 15 days. This festival honors the goddess Devi Durga,
			who is said to have slain the demon Durga, son of Ruru. Celebrants perform many pujas (offerings) during this 
			festival, including thousands of animal sacrifices. (September/October)<br><br>

			* Gai-Jatra, the Cow Festival. This festival focuses on families in bereavement. Every family who lost a 
			relative in the past year participates in a procession with a cow or a young boy dressed as a cow. The cow, 
			it is believed, helps the deceased reach heaven. (July/August)<br><br>
		
		<h2>Bisket Jatra, the Nepalese New Year celebration</h2>
			
			, in which chariots are pulled through the streets and ultimately a tug of war over them determines who
			will be blessed with good fortune in the coming year. This celebration is also observed with picnics and 
			other private get-togethers. (April)<br><br>
			<a href="images/bisket_jatra_by_tempo_sm.jpg"><img src="images/bisket_jatra_by_tempo_sm.jpg"align="left"></a>
			<b> Tihar, the festival of lights, honors Laxmi, the goddess of wealth.</b> The Nepalese light up their homes 
			with candles, oil lamps, and other lights to invite the goddess Laxmi in.<br>
			<b> Handicrafts</b> - Tourists can watch potters create works of art in the Pottery Squares. Indigenous (Newar)
			handicrafts include paubha scroll paintings, papier-mâché masks, cotton cloth, woodcarvings, metalwork, jewelry and
			ceramic products, haku-patasi (black sari), black caps and Juju-dhau (yogurt).<br><br>
			
			
		<h2>Travel & Tourism</h2><br>
			<a href="images/golden_gate_sm.JPG"><img src="images/golden_gate_sm.JPG"align="right"></a>
			Bhaktapur is rich in architectural beauty, filled with ancient Hindu and Buddhist religious 
			sites, and palaces and courtyards where tourists can easily spend days absorbing the traditions and culture of the Newars.<br>

			Bhaktapur's Durbar ('Royal') Square was added to the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1979.<br>
			<h2>Highlights & Features of the City and Surroundings:</h2><br>

		<a name="Durbar Square">
		<h2>Durbar Square</h2>

			Almost 1/3 of the ancient temples, monasteries, and other ornate buildings were destroyed in the earthquake of 1934. 
			Yet many gems remain.<br>
			Bhaktapur’s Durbar Square is the gem not only of Bhaktapur, but also of the entire nation. The most fascinating 
			structure here is the world-renowned 55-Window Palace. The elaborately carved windows and doors are something that
			visitors simply cannot help admiring. The seat of royalty before 1769 AD, the building now houses the National Art 
			Gallery—the museum better known for its rich collection of paubha scroll paintings and breathtaking artworks in stone.<br>
			The world famous Golden Gate rubs shoulders with the 55-Window Palace. An unparalleled specimen of repousse art
			dating back to 1756 , it is the entrance to the marvelous Taleju Temple Complex. Getting into it leads to a number 
			of artistica-lly designed chowks (courtyards) including the Royal Bath, which is adorned with the well-admired Golden
			Faucet among others.<BR>

			In Durbar Square, tourists will find the 55-Window Palace, which served as the seat of royalty prior to 1769.
			The palace has elaborately carved windows and doors and houses the National Art Gallery, with Buddhist Paubha scroll 
			paintings, palm leaf manuscripts, and stone carvings.<br>
			<a href="images/yachheswor_mahadev_temple_smJPG.jpg"><img src="images/yachheswor_mahadev_temple_smJPG.jpg"align="left"></a>

			Yachheswor Mahadev TempleJust outside the palace, at the entrance to the Taleju Temple Complex is the Golden Gate,
			built in 1756, a splendid example of Repoussé metalwork. There also lies the Royal Bath, with its Golden Faucet.<br>

		    Durbar Square is also home to the Big Bell, built by the last Malla king of Bhaktapur, Ranajit Malla in the 18th 
			century. It was rung to pay homage to the Goddess Taleju and to harken the public to town meetings.<br>

		    Today it is rung twice a day as a tribute to the Goddess Taleju. Next to this bell is the Barking Bell, so 
			named because dogs bark to its ring.<br>

		    Also in the Square lies the Yaksheswor Mahadev Temple, built by Yaksha Malla in the 15th century.
			It was modeled after the Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu and was designed with ornate wooden struts 
			decorated with erotic carvings.<br>

		    Other sites in and around the square include the octagonal Chyasin Mandap, Siddhi Laxmi Temple,
			Shiva Temple (Fasi-dega), Vatsala Temple, Bhandarkhal Complex, Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Indrayani Temple,
			Balakhu Ganesh Temple, Tripura-sundari Temple and the Char Dham symbolizing the four greatest Hindu pilgrimage sites.<br>

		    The Phasi Dega Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, affords expansive views of the entire city.<br>

		<h2>Taumadhi Square Nyatapol Temple- Bhaktapur, Nepal</h2><br>
			<a href="images/bhairav_temple_sm.JPG"><img src="images/bhairav_temple_sm.JPG"align="right"></a>
		    The Nyatpol (or Nyatapola) Temple, dedicated to the Goddess Lakshmi, lies in this square. Built in 1702 with 5 
			stories, this is Nepal's tallest pagoda temple.<br>

		    It's struts, doors, windows, and tympanums are decorated with carvings of divine figures, including a pair of 
			2 m high stone statues of the legendary Rajput wresters-Jaimal and Pata; a pair of elephants, a pair of lions,
			a pair of griffons and a pair of tantric goddesses known as Singhini and Toyahagrini.<br>
			The Nyataponla Temple presides over the Taumadhi Square. Dating back to 1702 AD, the colossal five-storied edifice
			is the country’s tallest pagoda temple. The struts, doors, windows and tympanums—each embellished with attractively
			carved divine figures—perfectly portray the creative tradition of Newar craftsmen. The temple is dedicated to Goddess
			Siddhi Laxmi, the manifestation of female force and creativity. The latest major renovation of this monument was 
			carried out in 1997 AD by Bhaktapur Municipality using the revenue it collected from tourists.<br>

			Next to the Nyataponla Temple is the rectangular shaped Bhairavnath Temple. It houses a gilded bust 
			of Bhairav, the ferocious manifestation of Lord Shiva. The three-storied pagoda was razed to the grounds by the 
			1934-earthquake, and its latest renovation was undertaken by Bhaktapur Municipality in 1995 AD.<br>
			
			The enclosed complex facing the Nyataponla Temple is dedicated to Tilmadhav Narayan, a manifestation of Lord Vishnu,
			who is one of the Supreme Triumvirate of Hindu pantheon. A few steps ahead it, to the southwest, lies the famous 
			Pottery Square, where visitors can see the city’s well-known potters making variously shaped and sized earthenware. 
			The major monumental highlight of this square is a temple of Jeth Ganesh, which dates back to the 14th century.<br>

		    The Bhairavnath Temple, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1934 and subsequently rebuilt, houses a 
			gilded bust of the terrifying Bhairav, considered either a manifestation of Lord Shiva or a deity that guards
			his home.<br>

		    Also here are a Pottery Square and the Temple of Jeth Ganesh, dating back to the 14th century.<br>
			Temples in Taumadi Square:
			Nyatapola Temple, Bhairav Temple, Teel Mahadeve Narayan Temple and many more.
		<a name="Dattatriya">
		<h2>Dattatreya Square</h2>

		    In this square, lie many of Bhaktapur's Hindu monasteries, called maths, as well as temples and museums.
			The three-story pagoda-style Dattatreya Temple, with statues of the Hindu trinity, was built by King Yaksha Malla
			in 1428. It is claimed that the building was constructed from a single piece of wood from one tree. <br>
			<a href="images/bhairav_temple_sm.JPG"><img src="images/bhairav_temple_sm.JPG"align="right"></a>
		    At the entrance are two large sculptures of the Jaiput wrestlers, Jaimala and Pata (as in the Nyatapola Temple),
			a “Chakra”, and a gilded metal statue of Garuda, a bird-like divinity. Around the temple are wood carved panels with
			erotic decorations.<br>

		    During the Mohani (Dashain) festival, in the Wane Layaku complex, which lies just southwest of the Dattatreya Temple, 
			a rare Ghau-batacha (water clock) is displayed.<br>

		    The Pujari Math, which houses the Woodcarving Museum and dates back to the early 15th century, is adorned with 
			the intricately carved Peacock Window. The Chikanpha Math, across the street, houses the Brass and Bronze Museum,
			with its collection of ancient Malla housewares and ritual metalware.<br>
			
			The Dattatreya Square is Bhaktapur's third dazzling gem. The seat of royalty till the 15th century, the area still 
			houses a great number of historic monuments including many wondrous Maths (residential mansions) and temples.The
			Dattatreya Temple is the main attraction of the Square. Constructed by King Yaksha Malla, the giant three-storied
			temple is believed to have been built with the stem of a single tree. Having defied series of calamities, it still
			bears testimony to the incredible achievement made in those regal days of the Nepalese history.<br>
			
			The Wane Layaku complex, which lies to the south-western corner of the Dattatreya temple, is noted for Bhaktapur's
			second Taleju shrine. Enclosed with old houses, the courtyard sees throngs of people, especially during the Mohani 
			( Dashain ) festival, when a rare Ghau-batacha (Water Clock) is put on public display. During the Malla Era, 
			the water-clock was used by the then rulers and astrologers for fixing "propitious moments" for commencing and
			concluding various state and social ceremonies.<br>
			
			The Peacock Window , which is also called the " Mona Lisa of Nepal ", is a rare masterpiece in wood. Dating back to
			the early 15th century, the unique latticed window has an intricately carved peacock in its center. The window adorns
			the Pujari Math which, with rows of exquisitely carved windows and doors, is equally appealing. The building presently
			houses the Woodcarving Museum . The museum has a rich collection of unique pieces in wood.<br>

			The Brass & Bronze Museum , housed in the historic Chikanpha Math , is the next highlight of the Square.
			It has a wide collection of bronze and brasswares including the ritual jars, utensils, water vessels, pots, 
			spittoons and similar other household items.Near the Dattatreya Square is the Wakupati Narayan Temple . Dedicated to
			Lord Vishnu, the two-storied structure is a unique specimen of pagoda architecture. Next to it is bhaktapur's second
			Pottery Square .Besides Bhaktapur's three well-acclaimed Squares, there are many other spots within the expanse where 
			visitors can experience a lot more. The recently-restored Ta-Pukhu (Siddha Pokhari) , Ancha-Pukhu , Khancha-Pukhu ,
			Barahi Temple , Lokeswor Mahavihar , Nava Durga Temple , the Terra-cotta Windows at Tuchhimala and Nepal's largest
			Shiva Lingum at Hanumanghat are some of Bhaktapur's monumental glories which tourists visiting this ancient city 
			simply do not like to miss.<br>
